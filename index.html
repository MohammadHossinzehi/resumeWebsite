            <p>
                I am a dedicated computer science student currently maintaining a high GPA. My passion for technology extends beyond the classroom, 
                as I am an avid gamer who enjoys playing FPS shooters like Valorant and Counter-Strike 2. My interest in electronics began at a very young 
                age, sparking a lifelong curiosity and enthusiasm for understanding how things work. This curiosity led me to start coding at the age of 12 
                on a platform called Scratch, where I quickly became captivated by the possibilities of programming.

                <br>
                Since then, I have honed my skills in various programming languages, including Java, C++, JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS, and PHP. 
                I am continually striving to expand my expertise and stay updated with the latest technological advancements. My journey in computer 
                science is driven by a deep-seated passion for learning and innovation, and I am always eager to take on new challenges and projects to 
                further my knowledge and skills.

            <p> 
                For this project, I developed a real-time chat room application using HTML, Java, and 
                JavaScript with WebSockets. The chat room enables seamless communication between two users, allowing them to exchange messages instantly. 
                The implementation leverages WebSockets for efficient, low-latency data transfer, ensuring a smooth and responsive chatting experience.
